# Post-doctorate in immersive scientific visualization of membrane proteins and their assemblies. (M/F)

## Project description

The LBT has developed original tools for visualization and analysis of protein structures, ported to advanced environments such as virtual reality headsets and display walls. This project aims to apply and improve the Unitymol approach to the study of membrane proteins and their assemblies. In particular, we plan to provide
broader support for the variety of structural data available today, especially for cryo-EM datasets, and to partner with the company PaleBlue and Prof. Lutz Eichacker at the University of Stavanger, Norway, to apply additional components of innovative and immersive drug discovery tools to membrane proteins of interest.

Supervision: Marc Baaden baaden@smplinux.de and Antoine Taly, taly@ibpc.fr

Collaborations : [PaleBlue company, Norway](https://pale.blue) and Prof. Lutz Eichacker at the University of Stavanger, Norway

**Context**
Most of the work will be carried out in the laboratory of Theoretical Biochemistry, a UPR 9080 unit of the CNRS led by Marc Baaden at the Institute of Physical-Chimic Biology in Paris, with regular exchanges with our Norwegian partners, including extended stays. Just over 29 people, including 15 statutory members, work in this laboratory, which is located in the heart of Latin Quarter. The project is led by Marc Baaden and Antoine Taly. The dual academic and industrial aspects are discussed. High quality material (virtual reality helmets, advanced display walls,...) will be provided. The work will be carried out in a multidisciplinary team.

The COFUND FP-DYNAMO-PARIS programme offers a unique interdisciplinary environment and a fundamental research initiative in the centre of Paris to train the scientists of tomorrow in the field of physico-chemical biology. The goal of the research programme is to integrate knowledge on gene expression, structural and membrane biology, and bioenergetics in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria in the general context of improving our understanding the biogenesis of energy-transducing membranes. These studies will involve cutting-edge technologies including structural biology (NMR, X-ray crystallography and CryoEM), RNA sequencing, mass-spectrometry, synthetic biology, microfluidics, computational modelling and visualization. Post-doctoral fellows will have the opportunity of developing their research projects in a dynamic scientific environment covering three main research themes: i) RNA biology from bacteria to chloroplasts, ii) Membrane system dynamics and iii) computational modelling of molecular assemblies. They will benefit from the supervision of internationally-recognised experts in their fields, a world-wide network of renowned institutions, cutting-edge research infrastructure and state-of-the-art technical know-how that will allow them to hone their scientific skills, make themselves known and increase their competitiveness on the labour market. Specific training will be proposed to ERs through attendance of the EMBO course on “Laboratory Leadership for Postdocs” included in a retreat in Padua, and involvement in dedicated complementary soft skill training events

**Constraints**: The contract must start between 1 January 2022 and 31 May.

**Salary** Gross salary will vary with candidate's experience starting at 3106€/month before taxes (around 2500€ after taxes) for candidate with less than 2 years post-doctoral experience. See the official CNRS salary table for researcher at http://labexdynamo.ibpc.fr/fp-dynamo-paris/

**Additional information**The application should be written in English and uploaded at https://emploi.cnrs.fr/. It should include a detailed CV, a minimum of two letters of reference, a letter of motivation describing your short and long term career objectives, and a signed declaration stating that you are in compliance with the mobility rule which stipulates that you have not resided or carried out your main activity (work or studies) in France for more than 12 months during the three years preceding the date of recruitment. In addition, the complete file must also be sent to Bruno MIROUX & Magdalena TORTYNA, respectively director and manager of the project at the following email address DYNAMOcofund@ibpc.fr (Tel: 33 1 58 41 50 64).

The position is intended as an initial step in a research career, and the assessment of the applicants will primarily be based on their research qualifications and their potential as researchers with skills that complement and strengthen on-going research within the partner institutions.
Step 1. The applications of each eligible candidate will be evaluated by independent international experts within the relevant research theme. Eligible applicants will be evaluated based on merits, motivation for the program, academic excellence and personal qualifications such as collaborative and communication skills.
Step 2. A maximum of three candidates will be retained for a video interview with the independent experts for each open position (Nov 2021). After the interview, candidates on the short list will be invited to a conference call with the project supervisor and a DYNAMO board member to define the general scope of the project, the training and the research environment. Candidates will be asked to draft a 3-page project proposal, bringing their own original ideas and will be given 2 weeks to submit it.
Step 3. Each project proposal will be evaluated by one of the independent experts and the DYNAMO board member who evaluated the candidate in the previous steps. The final selection will be made based on the scores obtained at steps 1, 2 and 3. The minimum score must be above 20/40. Top candidate will be offered the postdoc position with a starting date from January 1- May 31, 2022.
